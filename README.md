This project was the Project FMS that was developed by me & my team for the final project submission of the FSE100 course during my freshman year (Fall 2022) at ASU.
Furthermore, this was one my first team project and also first time working with p5.js. We developed the whole web-application in a span of 4-weeks. 
Also, we did not use Git has a version control system for the development of our project at that time, hence I have uploaded it here now.

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
As part of a three-member team, we created a web-based app with three individual games using p5.js. The objective was to enhance cognitive 
and physical abilities in toddlers, our target users. Each team member was tasked with developing an individual game.

PROJECT CONTRIBUTION DESCRIPTION: 
1) I developed the "Drag-On" game that aimed to help toddlers in cognitive learning by making them learn the different names of shapes as
   well as fine motor skills as they must use the feedback (received from the screen) with their eyes and ears and coordinate their fingers
   while dragging the shapes using the mouse.
2) As the Team Leader, I played a key role in the project by integrating all components and the three games, ensuring a seamless graphical
   user interface (GUI) throughout the application. My efforts involved coordinating various aspects of the project, debugging, and optimizing
   code to enhance user experience. This integration was crucial for the project's success, and I am proud of the functionality and aesthetic
   coherence achieved through my contributions.

My Team Members & their contributions:
1) Cody Yeung : Developed the "Tracking Game"
2) Chan Santawisuk  : Developed the "Tic-Tac-Toe"
